                <!-- Information goes here -->
                Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family to parents from Uttarakhand.[10][11] 
                He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.[28][29][30][12] His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand.[31] His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, 
                Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.[32] 
                Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".[31]Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya 
                Mandir school's football team,[33] but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, 
                picked him to play cricket for his school team.[34] His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando 
                Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season
                 Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.

            <div class="accordion-panel">
           n 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket President, 
           to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.[35] Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. 
           At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division.[36] Deval Sahay, 
           impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in the Bihar team.[37] 
                Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.

                2007 World Cup
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-panel">
                Preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup improved as India recorded identical 3–1 victories over West Indies and Sri Lanka and Dhoni had 
                averages in excess of 100 in both these series.[84]India unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage. 
                Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of JMM.[85] The local police arranged for security for his family as 
                India exited the World Cup in the first round.[86]Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring 91* against Bangladesh, 
                after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. 
                He was also later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at
                 an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.
               Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series.[87]
               Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in December 2005, was awarded an 'A' grade contract in June 2007.
              He was also elected as the captain of the Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in September 2007 after seniors players like Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly,
               Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble refused to be part of T20 format. India won the first ever ICC World Twenty20 Tournament by defeating Pakistan in Final making India's first solo ICC Trophy Win since 1983. The world cup win saw Dhoni as future captain of Indian cricket team in all formats.
              On 2 September 2007, Dhoni equalled his idol Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching five English players and stumping one.

        Dhoni stepped down as captain of India in the limited over formats in January 2017, 
        just ahead of the ODI series at home against England.[107] In the second game of the series, he scored 134 off 122 balls, that included a 
        256-run partnership for the fourth wicket along with Yuvraj Singh. 
        The century, his tenth in ODIs, was his first in over three years.[108] He was named as a wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament'
         at the 2017 Champions Trophy by Cricbuzz.[109] He was also named in the ODI XI of the year by Cricbuzz.[110]
     In August that year, during the fifth and final ODI against Sri Lanka in Colombo, he became the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings surpassing Kumar 
     Sangakkara, when he stumped Akila Dananjaya off Yuzvendra Chahal.[111] He reached the milestone of effecting 400 dismissals in ODIs in February 2018, following the 
       stumping of Aiden Markram in the third ODI of the South Africa tour.

        During New Zealand tour, he averaged 58.21 in the five-match ODI series[166] in which his all efforts went in
        vain as India were defeated 4-0. He made 214 runs at 71.33 in the two-match Test series that followed[167]
        including an unbeaten 105 on the last day of the second Test at Wellington that helped India save the
        match.[168] India then traveled to Bangladesh for the Asia Cup and World Twenty20. Dhoni was ruled out of the
        Asia Cup after suffering a side strain during the New Zealand tour, which led to Kohli being named the captain
        for the tournament.[169] dhoni scored 136 off 122 balls in India's opening match against Bangladesh, sharing a
        213 run third wicket stand with Ajinkya Rahane, which helped India successfully chase 280.[170] It was his 19th
        ODI century and his fifth in Bangladesh, making him the batsman with most ODI centuries in Bangladesh.[171]
        India were knocked out of the tournament after narrow losses against Sri Lanka and Pakistan in which Kohli
        scored 48 and 5 respectively.[49] Dhoni returned from injury to captain the team for 2014 ICC World Twenty20
        while Dhoni was named vice-captain. He scored 54 off 41 balls in the game against West Indies and an unbeaten 57
        from 50 balls against Bangladesh, both in successful run chases.[172] In the semi-final, he made an unbeaten 72
        in 44 deliveries to help India achieve the target of 173.[173] He won the man of the match for this knock. In
        the final against Sri Lanka India posted the target of 130/4 in which Kohli top scored 77 from 58 balls.
        Notwithstanding his innings, India lost the match by six wickets.[174] Kohli made a total of 319 runs in the
        tournament at an average of 106.33, a record for most runs by an individual batsman in a single World Twenty20
        tournament.[175] For his achievement he won the Man of the Tournament award.[176

        KDhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman. He deviates from conventional 
        coaching manuals and showcases his unique batting technique. Dhoni displays a proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries
         towards the Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than the conventional Cover region. Furthermore, he demonstrates remarkable skill 
         in playing pull shots and hook shots off short-pitched deliveries, putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length accordingly. Dhoni
          holds the bat with a firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force and precision to clear the boundary. Despite this, he still retains
           the capability to produce awe-inspiring, long sixes.[163][164] He is known for his unorthodox captaincy and cool-headed demeanor on the field. As a batsman,
            he is recognized for his remarkable finishing skills in high-pressure situations, and his aggressive captaincy has earned him the reputation of
         a successful leader in Indian cricket. He has also been renowned for his lightning-fast glove-work behind the stumps.

        India's match against Pakistan, dhoni became the fastest batsman in terms of innings to score 11,000 runs in ODI
        cricket. He reached the landmark in his 222nd innings.[255] Eleven days later in the match against the West
        Indies, dhoni became the fastest cricketer in terms of innings to score 20,000 runs in international cricket,
        doing so in his 417th innings.[256] dhoni scored five consecutive fifty plus scores in the tournament .
        Nonetheless, India lost the semi-final against New Zealand in which dhoni was out for just a run.[257] After the
        World Cup, India toured West Indies for 3 T20Is and 3 ODIs followed by two test matches .[258] dhonii was
        instrumental in ODI series win as he struck back to back hundreds in second and third ODI. He was awarded player
        of the series for his match performances.[259] In the following test series which India won 2-0, dhoni became

        24 innings with highest score of 89 and an average of 36.60.[272]

        latter part of the series and ended the series as the highest run-scorer from both sides with 231 runs to his
        name and 3 half-centuries at an average of 115.50. India clinched the series 3-2; Kohli was adjudged as the Man
        of the Series for his performances.[273] During the second T20I, Dhoni became the first ever batsman to complete
